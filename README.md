# AwsSnsAndSqs
This is a simple example that works with SNS (Simple Notification Services) and SQS (Simple Queueing Services) on AWS (Amazon Web Services)

For it to work on your machine you will need an AWS account and to have created Credentials to use. There is a lot of useful information
on the AWS site to help you with this. I've left my values in the app.config as a guide. 

This solution was based on the two AWS templates that come as part of the installation of the AWS SDK for .NET.

Note, that it takes two command line arguments.
