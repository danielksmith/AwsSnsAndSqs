# AwsSnsAndSqs
This is a simple example that works with SNS (Simple Notification Services) and SQS (Simple Queueing Services) on AWS (Amazon Web Services)

For it to work on your machine you will need an AWS account and to have created Credentials to use. There is a lot of useful information
on the AWS site to help you with this. I've left my values in the app.config as a guide. 

This solution was based on the two AWS templates that come as part of the installation of the AWS SDK for .NET. You will need to install that
SDK and add references to the appropriate DLLs to get this solution to work on your machine.

I installed the AWS SDK on my Windows 10 machine from this link:

Note, that this project takes two command line arguments.
